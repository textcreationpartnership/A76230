            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE WORCESTER-SHIRE PETITION DEFENDED, In an Answer to XVI printed Queries.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first Reason pretended against subscribing the <hi>Worcester-shire Petition</hi> for the Gospel and Ministry, by those few that scrupled it, was, that they knew not of any such Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets or Petitions against the Ministry, as the beginning of it expresseth. As I then produced a dozen for the conviction of some of them, so here's another now, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited by the same spirit, which if they will peruse, may further their satisfaction. The scope of it is to prove Christs Ministers (called Priests) to be 1. Conjurers: 2. Thieves and Robbers: 3. Antichrists: 4. Witches: 5. Divels: 6. Lyers: 7. A viperous and Serpentine generation, going about to murder and strangle the Childe <hi>JESUS:</hi> 8. Blasphemers, living in the Kingdome and Government of the Prince of the Air, strangers to the guiding of the eternal Spirit, &amp;c. 9. Scarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Beasts, a wel-favoured Harlot, &amp;c. 10. Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon's Merchants, selling beastly wares for a large price, &amp;c. 11. Whited walls, painted Sepulchres, professing something, possessing nothing: 12. Ravenous Wolves,
<pb facs="tcp:118390:3"/> evermore persecuting the pure Truth that the Saints live in: 13. Greedy dogs, alwayes striving about fat Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, &amp;c. Bloud-hounds, still hunting and gasping af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their prey; like the mouth of Hell, never satisfied: Money is their <hi>Diana:</hi> still barking and raging like So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites against any that delight in Purity, &amp;c. 14. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and Ambitious Pharisees, &amp;c. with more of the like. Also that our Publick Meeting-places are Idols Temples, that must down, &amp;c. And in the end are Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Queries to the <hi>Worcester-shire Petitioners.</hi> The Authours are many, not worth the naming, some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing one part, and some another: and sometimes da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thus to subscribe, <hi>WRITTEN FROM THE SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT OF GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know it will be judged a great weaknesse in mee, to regard the words of such men, so far as to mention them, or vouchsafe them any Answer: But I think we have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded them too long. 1. The silliest soul is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and must not be vilified or neglected. 2. Christ condescended to the meanest, both in Redeeming them, and conversing with them; He disdained not to dispute with a Samaritan, or a Canaanitish woman. 3. We are commanded to learn of him to be meek and lowly: to stoop to the very washing of the feet of our brethren: to condescend to men of low degreeâª and he that would be greatest, must be the servant of all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 21. 4. If the Governours of this Common-wealth doe think this to be meet language and Doctrine to be permitted by the Presse to be divulged to all their Subjects, it seems <hi>(horresco referens!)</hi> they take it not to be so intolerable and bad as we do: And if it have so far prevailed with the Brain of the Commonwealth, I think no inferiour person should
<pb facs="tcp:118390:3"/> make light of it. 5. Were it the absurdest Turk or Pagan that had liberty to speak so openly to all, there is a necessity that some should discover his vanity; for though he speak non-sense, if it be but earnestly, it will take with too many, if they understand but what hee drives at: For men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Doctrines not as the Doctrine it self deserveth, but as themselves are predisposed and capable. Ignorant sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly souls are sooner taken with such silly Discourses as are agreeable to their capacities, and familiar to their ears, then with the clearest demonstrations of a Learned man. And alas, if all the ignorant deceivable souls in this Land should be neglected, how small a number should be regarded? Contrarily, it is the most ignorant that have most need of Teaching: Wee should be ill Nurses, if wee think that all those Babes that want milk, should be rather contemned, then fed. 6. The most ignorant wretch may have as strong an arm, as fiery a spirit, and perhaps, to doe mischief, as crafty a wit as other men: If these beasts once know their own strength (as they never did more in our dayes) they may prove to Men more terrible then contemptible. Their Swords may be better then yours, though your poorest servant boy or wench may have more wisdome then they. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt will not save you from a mad man, or a wilde beast; nor will it quench a raging fire in the thatch of your houses. Experience hath taught us, how farr contemned men may prevaile, while wee sit still and slight them: and how successfully the sillyest servant of the Envious man may sow his tares, whilest wee are silent, or asleep. 7. I thought it worth a few hours writing, to shew the world so far the Honour of our <hi>WORCESTER-SHIRE Petition,</hi> that it hath none to open a mouth against it publickly, but such Miscreants
<pb facs="tcp:118390:4"/> as these. As I have known many souls confirmed about the veritie of the sacred Scriptures (after temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to infidelitie) by observing the evident Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Divels hatred and rage against it, and that all the opposition proceeded from him: so it is a great credit to our Petition, that it must be the mouth of the Divel that must speake against it. Let him that reads these Queries, but read the rest of the Book, and if hee finde not that it is the Hissing of the Serpent, and the Language of his seed, either he understands not that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or understands no other.</p>
            <p>My intended brevity prohibites me any longer Preface, then to give you these Reasons of my action, that you may not think mee prodigal of my time. And for the Uses of the whole Pamphlet which I oppose, I desire you to peruse them in the end, whither I reserve them.</p>

            <head>Certain QUERIES to the substance of the WORCESTER-SHIRE Petition; very necessary to be answered by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners thereof, said to be six thousand.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THey say, We know He granted their Commission (speaking of the Ministers of the Gospel, taking the Ministers of</hi> England <hi>in with them) upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of his Plenipotency, and upon his ascension gave them for the</hi> perfecting of the Saints, and the edifying of the body, till they come to his fulness, <hi>&amp;c, as in</hi> Eph. 4. 9. <hi>to</hi> 15. <hi>and hath promised,</hi> to be with them to the end of the world, <hi>to keep them stedfast,</hi> that they may not be tossed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with every wind of doctrine, &amp;c.</p>
            <div n="1" type="question">
               <head>Query I.</head>
               <p>Whether ever any of the Ministers now in <hi>England,</hi> have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the power to bring the Saints of God to perfection, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 12 of <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. And whether by the Spirit of God dwelling in them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by them, have been brought up to such a full unity of the faith, and of the knowledg of the Son of God, even unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, and to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, yea, or no? as in <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. You begin with a false recital, either of the Text, or of the words of the Petition, which ever it is that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: for the words, <hi>That they be not tossed about with every wind of doctrine,</hi> do express that benefit to the Church which God intendeth in giving them a Ministry; but are not applyed in the Text directly to the Ministers, as such; (though a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er favor to them is implyed.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the Ministers in <hi>England,</hi> whom that Petition doth mention, are given to the Church for the perfecting of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118390:5"/> Saints, and the edifying of the Body of Christ. But it doth not follow, that the Ministers of this Age must therefore bring the Church or Saints to perfection: for the Apostle speaks here of Christs giving a <hi>Continuation</hi> of Ministers, from his Ascension till the Church or Body of Christ be perfected; and so he speaks not of the perfection of each particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as it is antecedent to the perfection of the whole Body: but he speaks of perfecting the whole Bodie, by gathering home every member that is yet to be gathered, and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting each member in the perfection of the whole. This work therefore of perfecting is neither to be done conclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by any one Age of Ministers before the last age; nor upon any one Beleever till that last Age come. If a Prince resolve to build a Citie, and having begun it in his life time, he leave in his Testament a provision of maintenance for such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of workmen as in three or four Ages shall perfect the Citie: I hope you can understand, that every workman is given for the perfecting of this work, both they that lay the Foundation, and they that build the Walls, and they that lay on the Roof; and yet, though all are given towards the perfecting of it, all do not actually perfect it: All work for the perfection of the Building; but it is he that layes on the top stone that perfecteth it: Yet the intire work when it is accomplished, shall be ascribed as well to the former Builders as the last, according to the proportion of their interest in the Work. God hath promised such a succession of Builders till his House be finished; and he will make good his promise in despight of all the rage of Hell.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Even particular Saints are led on by the guidance of the Ministry, till they come to perfection. Though they are not capable of perfection of degrees of holinesse or happinesse in this life; yet the Vessell which shall convey them to the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of perfection, is steered and governed by the Ministers of Christ, under him the chief Governor: And when they are landed, their souls are perfected, in comparison of what they are here: though the most full and absolute perfection be only at Christs second coming and our Resurrection, when soul and bodie shall be joyned in felicitie.</p>

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Answ.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Wee cheerfully accept of Christs wages, it being the meer fruit of his bounty, and but in a very low and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive sense called <hi>wages:</hi> for we are so far from deserving it, that we deserve his wrath.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our fullest wages (yet of free gift) is expected by us in the life to come: yet in this life he hath made us provision for our journey.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What you mean by <hi>[Christs agreeing with us for wages]</hi> I know not whether you understand your selves: Wee made no capitulations with him, but thankfully accept of what he hath offered: And so we be sure of that in the life to come, we refer the rest the more cheerfully to his pleasure: and of the former, it hath pleased him already to assure us, if wee continue faithfull and overcome.</p>
                  <p>But you must be pleased to be informed, that God gives us our wages (as you call it) two wayes.</p>
                  <p>First, He gives us Right to it: And then he gives the Thing it self.</p>
                  <p>The Right which he gives us is by two distinct means and steps: First, He hath made a Law, commanding all the world to whom we preach his Gospel, to allow us a sufficient main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that we may not be hindered from or in his Work: But whether he hath setled the punctual proportion of Tenths, is a Dispute that I will not trouble you with. Onely I will tell you, that the world hath not yet answered severall judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Treatises that are written for it; and I do not expect you should answer them. It is enough for me, that Christ
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118390:6"/> hath commanded that men <hi>muzzle not the Ox that treadeth out the Corn;</hi> and said, <hi>Who goeth to warfare at his own charge? They that minister about holy things, live of the things of the Temple; even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. to 15. And Christ himself sent out his Disciples to preach, without any provision of maintenance of their own, because, <hi>The Labourer is worthy of his hire:</hi> We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it of men, though we deserve it not of God. Now if God have laid this command on men, no man can be said to be free to break it: Gods Lawes bind more then the Laws of men. 2. Yet because it is not Christs rule, that we should take it without mens giving, but that men should be his hand to reach it to us, therefore we have no actual immediate right to the individual Maintenance it self, till men obey Gods command by conferring it upon us. God hath made it every mans duty to do this freely of his own accord, so that he doth but Justice in doing it, and we are not beholden and indebted to him for it; (though to God we are.) And where any man will not do justice, and pay the Labourer the wages that he owes him, the Magistrate must see Justice done, or else I know not what he hath to do. I pray you tel me, if the Souldiers that you mention, that must be content with their wages, had been denied their wages by an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Clerk of a Company or Troop, had it been any sinful discontent to have complained to the Captain or Colonel? It seems by you, a man is not content with his wages, except he be content that men defraud him of it; nor content with the bountiful provision of Christ by his lawes, except he be content with the sinful refusal of men to obey those Lawes? I pray you hereafter distinguish a little better between dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with Christ, and with disobedient men; and between content with wages allotted by Christ, and content without it; and if you will add a third distinction, Between discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and the use of just means for relief. All this I have spoke only of Christs conferring our Right to our Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As for his Giving it us in actual possession: He
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118390:6"/> hath done his part as he is Law-giver, by commanding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to give it us; as a father that commandeth the elder brother to pay Legacies to the younger: But as the gracious Father of his chosen, and the disposer of all things, so he doth moreover, see that his Servants want nothing that is good for them, and hath promised that their wants shall turn to their good; he hath bid us <hi>be careful for nothing, but cast all our care upon him, who hath promised to care for us.</hi> And we find by experience, that he will not fail us or forsake us, and that it is blessed to trust in him; so that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with our wages, in which sense soever you mean it, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted us by Christ. If you mean it of allotting us our right by his Lawes, commanding our hearers to allow us sufficient maintenance; we are well content with his constitution, though not with mens disobedience: If you mean it of his providence, we are content (I can speak for my self) with the portion allotted: I confess I never wanted, but I hope I have learned to want, as well as to abound, though not by much experience; yet was I glad within this dozen years, to preach the Gospel for little, and sometimes for nothing. I think the case of many of my brethren, is the same in this with mine; and he that searcheth my heart knoweth, that it was an earnest thirst to win souls to Christ, that drew me into the Ministry; and that in the course of it, I sought not <hi>Theirs</hi> but <hi>Them;</hi> and that I never took pleasure in any maintenance or worldly accommodation, if I saw not the work of the Spirit prosper on the souls of my people, and then I thought I was paid to the full. And let me tell you a word in your ear that may displease you; All those of your party which have a design to extirpate the Gospel, by the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a judicious, faithful Ministry, and that by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing their maintenance, will find your selves very much deceived: for if you do so far prevail, by Gods permission, (for the ungrateful slighting of the Gospel in this Land) as to take down the stablish'd maintenance of the Ministry, we are resolved to preach never a Sermon the less, but labour with our hands; yea, beg our bread, rather then give over the work of God, especially when by the invasion of Ignorance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118390:7"/> and Schisme, the Churches necessities are increased: I tell the Divel this too, if he do not know it, that he may know what success to expect of his present designs: And I hope all faithful Ministers do second me in these resolutions.</p>

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Answer.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Christs setting Ministers under him in his Church, is no resigning it to them: We are but Ushers, and Christ is the only Prophet and chief Master of the School.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who put it into your heart to question, whether we should rule them at our own will? your Query intimates, as if we maintained or pleaded for such a power: and Gods Spirit is not the Author of lying and slandering; <hi>Ergo,</hi> you sure speak not by the Spirit. We openly profess, that we must rule our flocks according to the will and word of Christ; and that if we speak contrary to this, none ought to believe us; or command any thing contrary to this, none ought to obey us: but then they must prove it contrary, and not falsly say so, when we manifest that we speak the words of truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For <hi>[having all the profit]</hi> you speak carnally, as if you
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118390:7"/> thought a maintenance for our bodies while we are doing Christs work, were <hi>[all the profit]</hi> that his flock yeilds; I doubt you would fain partake your selves more of such profits, that you speak so esteemingly of them. The profit of Christs flock is their own salvation, and (Metaphorically) Gods glory. Lest you should long too much for such profit, I'le tell you some of mine. If I would have addicted my self to secular imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I might have lived possibly in Honour in Riches, and in health; for many are Colonels and men of great place in the world, that had not so fair opportunities of rising as I. Some that have preached in the same Pulpit with me, have cast off their black coats, and put on Scarlet, and are become men of great Wealth and Dignity. Law, or Physick, or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery would have afforded a man Honors and Riches: but what get I in the Ministry? I'll tell you but the truth; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Study, Preaching, and all other labours, hath utterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown my health; and I know not one hard Student and painful Preacher of many, but is languishing or sickly; yet though I am day and night full of pain, study I must, preach I must, I must visit the sick, instruct the ignorant, resolve the doubting, comfort the dejected and disquieted soul, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish the scandalous and relapsed: as far as I am able, these must be done, and very much more; besides defending the truth against all wrangling Seducers: and when all this is done, what is my profit? Many a time heretofore, have I had the people secretly and openly reviling, slandering and cursing me: if I do but gal a guilty conscience, I provoke their cruel ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; much ado to bring a few sinners to the sense of sin, and the true knowledg of Christ, and when we think we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished it, how many of them fall back? if there do but any Seducer come in among them, what danger are they in of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their Delusions, before the Truth can have time to take rooting in them? How easily are these <hi>tossed up and down as children, and carried to and fro with every wind of doctrine?</hi> and though it be not much that Seducers have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in my own Charge, yet it is so in many others, to the grief of all that know and love them: In a word, between the obstinateness of the ungodly, the ignorance of the weak,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118390:8"/> and the pride, self-conceitedness and unruliness of Professors the life of a Minister is so heavy a burden, and such a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual grief, that I confess from my heart, I have been many a time haunted with <hi>Jonas</hi>'s temptation, to over-run Gods work and to put it off, as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> would have done: we have flesh and bloud as well as other men, for we are but men: and when in the time of temptation, I have hearkned to the flesh, this hath been the language of it, [Was not I born as free a man as others? why must I then be tied up to this despised, hated, weary work? why may not I take that course, where I may have a fuller maintenance without grudging, as other men have? but that I must live with the grievance and repinings of others, as if I took the bread from their mouthes! where all that I receive is thought too much, and all that I give too little; where more is expected to be given back then I receive! Why must I sit from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to night in consuming studies, or else be instructing and admonishing them that will hate me for it? why must I live in continual pain and languishing, when other mens labours tend to their health? I must be groaning in my own sorrowes, and weeping for the obstinacy and danger of others, when other men go pleasantly about their work: and when I have laboured for them night and day, the thanks I must expect is to be hated and scorned by the ungodly, to be tired with the great unteachableness of the ignorant, to be grieved with the pride, unruliness and passions of Professors, and by such as these Pamphleters, to be called Dog, and Divel, and Bloud-Hound, for taking but my own, which never was theirs nor their forefathers; and for contradicting the silliest Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, that speak the grossest falshoods in the name of Gods Spirit.] Such thoughts as these the flesh hath too oft sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested; so that I confess, had I but free liberty to lay by this Calling, which you so reproach, my flesh would take it for the happiest hour that ever I saw. But do I approve of this, or grudge at my Imployment, and the disposal of my God? No, I bless the Lord daily, that ever he called me to this blessed work! it is but my flesh that repineth at it, God hath paid me for all these sufferings a thousand fold: O the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118390:8"/> sweetness of sacred Studies and Contemplations! they are the Recreations of my Spirit, though a weariness to the Flesh! O the Consolations that I have in the very opening his Gospel Mysteries, and in revealing the Hopes of the Saints, and the unseen glory of the Life to come! O how the Lord doth sweetly revive my own Faith, and Love, and Desire, and Joy and Resolution, and all Graces, whilst he sets me on those thoughts in my Studies, and those perswasions in my Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which tend to revive the Graces of my Hearers! O the sweet comfort that I have in the abundant success of my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, in the Conversion and Confirmation of souls, and in the Mortification and Vivification of my godly Friends! for it is not all, that are the Discouragers before mentioned. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods work is most precious wages! yea, even my suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for him, are the inlets of my Joy! and my constant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience assureth me, that the dearer it costeth me to serve him, the more abundant will be the in-comes of my Peace! and that no man shall ever be a loser by him! I would not therefore change my life for any of the greatest Dignities on earth: I had rather thus serve in the Gospel, and at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of my Lord, and be called Dog and Divel, so he will but go on to bless my Labors, then to be bowed to, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the world, and to be swelled with Riches, Titles, and Vain-glory to the utmost Greatness that the world can afford: I am willing to wait on God in this Work, and think my lines and lot well fallen; I am contented to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume my body, to sacrifice my Reputation to his Service; and to spend all that I have, and to be spent my self for the sake of men, though the more I love, the less I may be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: can I win the love of some of them to God, it is a less matter whether they love me (if not loving men would but consist with loving God). I have spent all these words, only to this end, to let you see what that life is that you so envy at; and what that great profit is, that you think attends the Ministry: A Physician can get Three hundred Pounds, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a thousand Pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> a Minister is reviled as a greedy Dog, meerly because he hath a mouth to eat. In so doing, what do you but rail at God, that he did not

                  <p n="1">1. Our hope is in the Hope of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Lord Jesus, for the invisible things of the Glory to come: Of this we have the more reason to be ready to give an account, because we know we must shortly stand at the Bar of our Lord, where the grounds of hope must be revealed, and where he that speaks by your tongues against our Hope now, will himself speak against it then; even the great Accuser of the brethren will do the same work that you are now doing, that is questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hopes of life by Christ; I have therefore no more to say to this question now, but to tell you, This is not the Judgment day. If you say, We must be damned; and if we say, Through Christ we hope for life; neither of our say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will decide the case; but if you will do this work, you must meet us at Judgment, and there we must give in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, where we look to be assaulted by a more subtil enemy. It may be as the Saints being absolved, shall judg the world with Christ; so the wicked being condemned, shall accuse the Saints with Satan; but that I know not: only I know, that you shall be there accused your selves; and he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh you now to question our hopes, will then question yours: And therefore I warn you, that you provide your own Defence, as well as your Accusation of us.</p>

May not your servant here serve two Masters, and expect wages from both, as long as they be not two co-ordinate masters, which Christ speaks of, but one subordinate to the other? yet, be it known to you, that we take not the Congregation for our Masters: A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is a servant for the Church, but not of the Church: He is Christs servant, and not mans, though yet he be a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the Commonwealth.

Do we go about to get any new establishment by Law? or only desire that the Law may not be destroyed, that giveth us the same right in the Tenth, which you have in the Nine parts? Do you not deal by us, just as if you met a True man on the High-way, that had but three Shillings in his purse; you take away two of them, and when you are about taking away the third, he desires you would leave him that to supply his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118390:10"/> necessity: you call him Bloud-Hound, greedy Dog, and Divel, and all that's naught, and Religiously tell him, he is unlike Christ, that bid him <hi>suffer wrong, and if any man take his coat, give him his cloak also, and resist not evil, &amp;c.</hi> So, much of the Churches necessary means is alienated already; (whose these were shall be known shortly, when God will convince the proudest and subtillest Disputers, that Sacriledg is a sin;) and now you would have Tithes, and all stablish'd Maintenance down too, and rail at us, as being unlike the Apostle, for contradicting you, and for saying, [We pray you Gentlemen, do not rob God and his Church; or if you will venture to be Thieves, because you shall not be judged till death, yet be merciful Theeves, and take not all.

The Spirit of God is not a lying Spirit, nor dictates slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that so impudent, that the whole Country that shall but read your Book, do know them to be lies and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. 4. Whether such impudent Lyers are like to be Christs Prisoners (as you call your selves?) or to be fit men to reform the Churches, and discover the errours of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as you pretend? 5. Whether those in this Nation that are led about by such as you, are not unquestionably led by the Divel, the Father of Lies? Having put these questions to you, I answer further,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Enquire better hereafter whether the Gentlemen that presented the Petition were against the Parliament? One of them was Governour of <hi>Warwick</hi> Castle through all the first Warrs; the other is wel known in <hi>London,</hi> and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Parliament, to be none of their adversaries. There is one Colonel and two Captains of the Army that were his houshold Servants. Enquire whether those of the <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-shire</hi> Committee that subscribed the Petition, were such as you describe them. Enquire whether the present Major of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and the Major of <hi>Evesham,</hi> and the Bailiffs and Justices of <hi>Bewdley, Kiderminster,</hi> and other places, that subscribed it, were enemies to the Parliament? or whether any of these were such friends to the Bishops? If you have no better informer, let me tell you, that it was the generalitie of the godly men who have been still for the Parliament, that subscribed this Petition; (though I would I could say, that every man were godly that did subscribe it:) And that it was not urged on any; nor so much as sent to one half of the County, or very neer: And that a great part of the County took only the hands of Housholders, and not Sons or Servants; else many thousand more hands might quickly have been got: and that the Gentlemen and most others that ever were of the Kings party, were either never asked to subscribe, or (those very few that were, of whom I hear but of one or two) did in modestie refuse, lest their names should raise a prejudice in any against the Petition. So far is it from being true, which you speak, <hi>of many of them</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:118390:12"/>
                     <hi>now alive being the only promoters of this Petition.</hi> O where was shame, conscience, fear of God, or belief of any future judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when this was written! And let me tell you, those of us that have been most against Bishops, are not so far run out of our wits through opposition to them, as to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallize such as you with them. We think, that for such as you to reproach men for being for Bishops, is as if a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Robber should reproach him that once in anger gave his neighbour a box on the ear. The fearful wickednesse, and dotage, and Apostacie which such as you have been lately gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to, I dare say, hath done more to confirm many in their Judgments for Episcopacie, and for the late King, and hath done more to disgrace the present Cause of the present Parliament, and to raise an <hi>odium</hi> through the sober part of the world, on the Armie; yea, and to cause many sober, godly men to repent at the heart, that they once so scorned or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the motions for a godly, regulated, moderate Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy: I say, the Examples of such as you, have done more to this, then all the learned Disputings in the world was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to have done without it: Yea, you have given the Papists themselves such advantage, that they think they have the poor ignorant people at the advantage of the Welsh Dilemma, <hi>Chuse whether you will goe to Rome, or to Bedlam.</hi> Though I know God will shew the sober and humble a way to escape both.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, How could you without trembling and blushing, thus publish your intimation to the world, That it was the Bishops, and the Kings Clergy that these Petitioners intend, when the world may see, that they mention no mans name in the Petition? and for their qualitie and character, they petition for no man but onely <hi>Godly, Faithful, Able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi> Would you have the world believe, that none but the Kings party were such? Or if these Petitioners had meant the Kings party, what danger was in that, when they leave it to the Parliament to judg who are godly, faithful, and able, and who not? If the Parliament judg right, and mean well, our meaning can do no harm. I proclaim to you and the world, Let our Petition be granted according
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118390:12"/> to the proper sense of those words [for a godly, able, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ministry] and we will take it thankfully, and not say, that they cross'd our meaning. Yea, let me tell you, that I read a Paper delivered by several Justices of the Peace, and other Gentlemen to Colonel <hi>Bridges,</hi> wherein they desired [him and Mr. <hi>Tho. Foley</hi> to present their Petition to the Parliament; and if they had opportunity, to expresse to them, that they spoke not for any ignorant, unsufficient, scandalous Ministers, but earnestly desired the continuance of the Parliaments care for the casting out of all such.]</p>
                  <p>I hope by this time the world may see what Truth to expect from such Teachers as you; that dare speak thus so openly, where it is so easie to disprove you. And lest you should think I speak on as great uncertainties as you, know that I saw and perused all the Subscriptions that came from every Town, Village or person in the County, and therefore speak not on blind conjectures.</p>

Bring yee all the Tithes into the Store house, that there may be meat in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windowes of Heaven, and pour out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruit of your ground, neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before her time in the field, saith the Lord of Hosts.

                     <hi>set it order things that are wanting.</hi> If now many Cities had petitioned <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain them Elders, had this been Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy and robbing God of his honour? <hi>David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Josiah, &amp;c.</hi> were to set the Priests and Levites in their order, and charge them to do their Duty: if any had petitioned them in a vacancy of the Priesthood, to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them Priests, had they blasphemed, when it was their duty? If any seduced Village should petition the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to let one of you be their Teacher, I do not believe you would have called it Blasphemy. Furthermore, rub your eyes a little, and consider; God bids us ask of him our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread; the same God bids Parents give their Children, and Masters their Servants, their daily bread, <hi>(For he that provideth not for his own Family is worse then an Infidel,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 8.) Is it Blasphemy now for a Child or Servant to ask bread daily of the Father or Master? or is it a giving them Gods glory? Nay, suppose a Parent so unnatural, or a Master so unjust, as that he will not pay a servant his wages, or give his children bread; may not the Magistrate compel him to it, and put him to death if he famish his children? Why may not you say, Children and Servants must take that which God alloweth them as well as Ministers? God hath left it to the Parent, and not determined just how much portion he shall allow his children, and yet if he wrong his child even in that, the Law of the Land may right him.

                  <p n="2">2. Do not all know that Ministers have no power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute you, or to put you out of the Vineyard? they can but perswade others to do it, and so may you by them, and do in this Pamphlet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Prove your Call into the Lords Vineyard: You use to bid us prove our Call. We have the concurrence of all these 1. Gods competent qualification of us to do his work. 2. A desire to spend and to be spent for mens salvation: 3. The ordination of Christs Church Officers, appointing us to this work: 4. A willingness of mind to be joined as Officers to that particular Church, that we are called to. 5. The consent of that Church that we should be their Officers. If you say
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118390:16"/> that we boast of what we have not in any of these: I challenge any of you to come and make good any such Accusation. If you say, We have too much in any of these particulars; then we are on the safer side the hedge; for it seems then, we want nothing essential to the Ministry. If you say, They are no Churches that consent: we shall take it for a slander till you prove it; which you will never do. Now I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to shew as full a Commission: These Papers of yours shew that gross ignorance in you, that proves you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified to be common members of a Church, much more, to be Teachers. And certainly, such Railers, Slanderers, Lyars without any blushing or fear, were never sent by God to be Labourers in his Vineyard.

                  <p n="2">2. As for the wages of the world that you so ignorantly talk of; might you not as well have accused Christ or the Apostles for appointing a worldly wages? We desire, I tell you, no more then they have allotted us. If you say, Christ constraineth none to pay Ministers. I answer, as before, Christ immediately constraineth none to pay debts, or rents, or to relieve their children; and yet Magistrates must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain them, for they must do Justice, which is to see that all have their Due: And this Christ hath appointed as our Due. Yet I shall shew you anon that we ask nothing at all of any man. We desire no man to give us a farthing of his own, but only to deliver us that which is ours. And for trusting Christ for our wages, I trust him heartily, and bewail my distrust: and doubt not but he will enable me to trust him, though all the stated Maintenance of Ministers were down; yea, though I found no favour from Magistrates, but opposition: Under all the wrongs of man Christ is still to be trusted.

               <p>Is it not Covetousness and Theft, or violent detaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans goods, for any man to refuse to pay Tithes? We do not desire you to give us yours, but only to divide ours from yours. Have not we the same Law to give us a proprietie in the Tenths, which gives you proprietie in the other nine? If we have no right, you have none. Was the Tenth ever yours, or is it any mans else living? did not your fathers or forefathers, that bought or took Leases of your Land, understand that they must pay the Tenth as well as their Rent? and did they not buy them on those terms, and pay so much the less in Purchase, Fine, or Rent? Would not the Seller or Landlord have made you pay a tenth part more, if it had not been for your paying the tenth to the Ministers? And would you take that by force which was never yours, nor was ever paid for by your selves or your forefathers? Your

And is it not an injury to Patrons, whose Ancestors having been Benefactors to the Church, have left the disposal to their Care?

               <p>Nay, Have not Ministers yet a far better title to their Maintenance then ever a Lord or Knight in the Land? I think they have, in two Respects: 1. This particular Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which they have, was by the Donors dedicated and devoted to God, and so God himself is the primary Owner. I speak not of proper donation: for I know, that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Absolute Lord of all, we are not capable of giving to Him in a full sense, so as to make that his own, which was not so before: But as a Father will try his Childe, when he hath given him an Apple, whether hee will give him some again: So God will have a voluntary resignation of a portion for his especiall use: which we are said to give him in the same sense as we are said to give our selves to him in our baptismal Covenant; or as <hi>Hannah</hi> gave <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> to him. Now because God is not visible, and needs not any thing of ours for himself, therefore he wil have us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it to his use: which is especially to his Worship, and to his poor: And though these be the Uses, yet God is the Owner; not onely by his own Dominion, but also by our Forefathers Dedication and voluntary Resignation: and therefore it is justly called Sacriledg, or Robbing of God, to detain it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet more, If there had never been a foot of Land, or any Tythes dedicated to God in <hi>England,</hi> yet he who is the Absolute Lord, hath excepted a sufficient Maintenance for his Ministers, and commanded all that hear them to pay it them. So that this is the strictest way of appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, when God shall appropriate it to himself, as he did the Portion of the Priests and Levites, and the Offerings, and the First-born, &amp;c. God hath not determined or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that any Lord or Knight in <hi>England</hi> shall have to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118390:17"/> him and his Successors a sufficient estate continued them; if they fel that they have, they may be beggars. But God hath taken a more special care of his Ministers (for his Church and Worship sake) that <hi>they that preach the Gospel shall live of the Gospel,</hi> and be accounted <hi>worthy of double honour.</hi> So that if this be denyed now, here is a double Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledg; A detaining of what God in general hath Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and Appropriated to his use; and a detaining of what hath been particularly Dedicated to him by our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

Do you not undeniably permit the inundation of that sin which will bring remediless Ruine on the Land, even on you and us? And then what good will it do to prepare Shipping and Armies, when God hath told you there is no remedy? You have seen that the hand of God can quickly, and with small means accomplish his will, and execute his Judgments on the Greatest that least fear it. To be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, through unbelief or carnal confidence, after such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences as you have seen of the wonderful Providences and Judgments of God; would leave you as unexcusable, I think, as ever were any since <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> or at least since <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi>'s daies.

As for them that question your Power in matters of Religion, they thereby question your very Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Power it self. For what is your Office and Power, but as Ministers of God to see his Lawes executed, as far as you can? and I know you doubt not but the written Lawes are his Lawes, as well as that of Nature? Your own Lawes are but the determinations of Particulars which God hath determined only in General, for the better executing of the Lawes of God; or else the meer enforcing of Gods own Lawes. To shut out God and his Honour from your Office, is a greater mistake then to shut out the securing of your own (subordinate Analogical) Soveraignty. If you should make a Law, That he should die that denies the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Justice of Peace, but he shall go unpunished that denieth the Soveraign Authority, it were not half so bad as to ordain death for the denying of your Authority, and to permit men unpunished to deny the Authority of God or the Lord Jesus, or notoriously to dishonour him.

How easily do these
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118390:22"/> unquestionable Principles of Policy, dispel the clouds of those Objections and Cavils, whereby some would draw you into High Treason against Christ, your absolute Soveraign, as if it were a Tolerable sin for a Subject to strike at Christ the very Head and Center of the Commonwealth! The God of Heaven that vindicated his Name and Glory by Wonders in <hi>New-England,</hi> I hope will vindicate it as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully here, if we must come to the same extremity. But because God useth not Miracles, till ordinary means faile, (when there is no Christian Magistrate, the Apostle will kill <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> for Sacriledg and Lying, by a Miracle). O do not you that have the Sword in your hand, put the jealous God to it, to take it into his own, lest you have the first blow your selves, and you and we should perish toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I know many say, that God and his Truth have no need of your help, and that Truth is stronger then Error, and therefore all may have liberty to speak without such danger as is pretended. I will not trouble you with those many things, by which, I dare say, I am easily able to shame this Object on, and all of the like nature. Only these three things I would demand.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Doth not God ordinarily work by means? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where he wil permit seducing means, he usually permits seducement. Was it not a Judgment on <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> to have a lying spirit tolerated (for their sin) to deceive the false Prophets, and so the King? O let not the same Spirit loose in <hi>England,</hi> so far as lies in you to restrain him! God is sufficient to deliver the Nation from enemies without you, and needs not the help of you or your Armies: but should you therefore neglect our defence?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What more easie to know, then that the best cause may seem bad through a disadvantage, and that it is as easie to deceive the common people, if men have liberty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and opportunity, as can be almost imagined? Is not Error more consistent with carnal interests, and sutable to depraved nature? and Novelty pleasing to many? who knows not that men receive not things as they are, but as they seem, and that he that can make a lye seem true, may
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118390:23"/> cause it to be believed? and that, <hi>Recipitur ad modum reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientis?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I beseech you consider impartially, whether this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come not from grossest ignorance, or against consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Do they perswade you to do by God and mens souls as you would be done by? Will you give any man that will, leave to perswade, by Press and Pulpit, your Army to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, or to cast off their Commanders, and turn to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy? Will you think it a sufficient Argument for this, to say, Truth is stronger then Error; and all should be heard? Would you permit any rogues that will, to have access to your wives, and solicit them to Unchasteness, because Truth is stronger then Error? Would you let any man freely perswade your children to steal your Goods for them, or to hate their Parents, or forsake them; because Truth is stronger then error? you would say rather, [But the wits of children are not stronger then crafty Knaves] would you (I pray you lay it to heart) I say, would you, have all the Parents in <hi>England</hi> give that toleration to their Children, which you give (much less which these would have you give) to Subjects? O what a fearfull plight should we then be in? And is it not the same Commandment which prescribes the Parents duty, and the Magistrates; even both in one terme?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea, I will adde one more: Do not a multitude of such Pamphlets as this which I gain-say, shew you, what Truth it is that the world must needs hear? The Argument is, that Truth must be heard; and therefore all that seemes Truth must be heard, that it may be knowne. But are you in doubt whether these be truths which the world needs infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of? Is Railing at Christs Ministers as Dogs and Devils, this necessary Truth? And for those that urge by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the toleration of opposition of Jesus Christ, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Gospel worship, you may see what men they are: It seems they are unresolved whether these be Truth. I have long feared, that the Religion desired by some in these times, who once endeavoured the like in <hi>New-England,</hi> is nothing but Paganism, or Infidelity: I mean, that <hi>Plotinus</hi> is their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the name of Christ is used but to preserve their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118390:23"/> or at least that they are nothing less then Christians indeed. What I have said against this liberty of the Press, I mean also against the like liberty of the Pulpit. I abhor as much as most do, too rigorous restrictions, &amp; not bearing with each other in tolerable differences: But that a Pulpit should be Satans Oracle, or a place to make Christianity contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is very sad. Let all the Apothecaries in <hi>London</hi> have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to keep open shop: But O do not under that pretence, let a man keep an open shop of poysons, for all that will to destroy themselvs freely; as <hi>Giles Calvert</hi> doth for soul-poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. No, nor suffer any to be an Apothecary, that knows not poyson from Physick.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Use also (me-thinks) all ordinary Christians should make of such Books and examples as these. Take heed of Pride, and self-conceitednesse, and forsaking your necessary dependance on faithfull Teachers; and of thinking you know more then you doe. Doe you not see in the sad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this Age, whither this will bring people that seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fear God? As the Chickens that go too soon from the Hen, may be catcht up by the Kite; so are those people by the spirit of darknesse and delusion, that too soon are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of their own understandings, and forsake the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Conduct of their Guides. O what sad work hath this made in <hi>England?</hi> And for my part, I see no hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, till Christians are better convinced of the duty of submitting to Christs Officers, and how far it extendeth. <hi>Let him that thinks he standeth, take heed lest he fall:</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he think he can stand without the helps that God hath appointed him. God set Pastors and Teachers in his Church on purpose to prevent the instability and Apostacy of the Members, that they should <hi>not be as children, toss'd up and down, and carried to and fro with every wind of Doctrine, according to the cunning sleight and subtilty of men, whereby they lye in wait to deceive,</hi> Ephes. 4. 12, 13. 14. You see in the Pamphlet that I oppose, what notorious Malignants Professors may become. Take heed of receiving false reports of your Teachers, or entertaining Grudgings, and Quarrels, and Censures of them; lest yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>ãâ¦ã</desc>
               </gap> would
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118390:24"/> once have pluck'd out your eyes for them, do turn their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, because they tell you the Truth! And lest you that now think their feet beautiful, be quickly brought to spit in their faces, and think it your duty to call them greedy Dogs, Bloud-hounds, Witches, Divels, &amp;c. and dare subscribe your Revilings as these Railers do, <hi>Written from the Spirit of God:</hi> which me thinks a tender heart should tremble to read.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lord perswade also all Ministers of the Gospel to search their hearts and waies, and humble themselves before God for those sins that have procured all this upon us: For all our neglect of the souls of men, especially the less publick part of our work; and for our too much minding the things of this world; and our preferring our Rights before the winning of souls, and for want of Zeal for the House and Worship of God, and sitting still without a through Reformation, and leaving Dogs and Swine in the Church, and crying out on the Parliament for want of Authority, when we will not use the Authority given us by Christ. Especially, the Lord bring it close to the hearts of Dividers and Leaders of Factions, to see how they have kindled that fire of dis-esteem and reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst each other, which burns like hel, and none can quench. And O that God would suddenly and successfully perswade them to seek to each other for Accommodation, and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and Unity, and from Heaven to give a Blessing to such Endeavors;</p>
